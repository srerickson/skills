# Checksum Validation (CPP-002)

**Short Definition:** The TDA validates checksums against those stored in the Information Package at Ingest or Access.

## Description and Scope
The Checksum Validation process compares the checksums that come with the *Information Package*, with checksums based on the current state of the *File*'s data. Checksums of *Files* are validated at *Ingest* or *Access* to a TDA. The checksums may be either part of 1) a *SIP*; 2) an imported *AIP*; or 3) an *AIP* stored in the *TDA*.

A misalignment between the checksum algorithms used in the *Information Package* and the TDA's checksum policy's list of algorithms may occur. For example, incoming *Information Packages* (*SIPs* and *AIPs*) may include a checksum with a different algorithm created by the producer. In the case of *AIPs*, the checksum policy might have been updated during the lifecycle of the TDA, resulting in the removal and/or addition of algorithms. In such cases, the process should use whatever algorithm is associated with a given checksum to the best of its potential.

| Requires                | CPP-001     | CPP-002 relies on fixity information as produced and stored by CPP-001, but<br>                    only<br>                    during CPP-025 Enabling Access and<br>                    CPP-006 AIP Batch Export. During CPP-029 Ingest, the fixity information supplied<br>                    by the SIP will be used instead. |
| Required by             | CPP-006     | To ensure the integrity of the data during transport from the TDA storage the<br>                    exported Files' checksums need to be verified. |
| Required by             | CPP-025     | As the *DIP* is created, all *File* checksums need to be<br>                    validated to ensure that the *DIP* is representative of the *AIP*. |
| Required by             | CPP-029     | For any *SIP* submitted to the TDA all included *File* checksums<br>                    need to be checked to validate the integrity of the *Files*. |
| Affinity with           | CPP-004     | All new *AIP* copies must have their checksum validated to verify that<br>                    the process was successful. However, the checksum validation is more mechanical<br>                    in its nature, only aiming at verification of the copy process. The CPP-002<br>                    checksum validation is more comprehensive (including negotiations with<br>                    producers and validation of results). |
| Affinity with           | CPP-030     | All new *AIP* copies must have their checksum validated to verify that<br>                    the process was successful. However, the checksum validation is more mechanical<br>                    in its nature, only aiming at verification of the copy process. The CPP-002<br>                    checksum validation is more comprehensive (including negotiations with<br>                    producers and validation of results). |
| Affinity with           | CPP-011     | When *Files* are replicated, successful replication is validated by<br>                    comparing the replicated *Files'* checksums against the original *Files'* checksums |
| Not to be confused with | CPP-003     | Both CPPs get input from CPP-001, and both calculate a checksum from an *Information<br>                    package* and compare it to a given checksum. The difference is that CPP-002<br>                    is done during the *Ingest* or *Access* phases (relating to<br>                    transfer of content, changes in space), while CPP-003 is done periodically<br>                    during the preservation of the contents in the archival storage (relating to<br>                    changes over time). Thus, CPP-002 and CPP-003 are not only triggered by<br>                    different processes, but also trigger different responses. |
