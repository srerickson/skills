# Object Management Reporting (CPP-013)

**Short Definition:** The TDA delivers reporting to enable the effective management of Objects. This must include a wide range of functional, operational, and statistical reports and analytics.

## Description and Scope
Object management reporting is a process in which the TDA creates reports; outputs *Provenance metadata*; and produces statistical data on the content it preserves. The reporting is needed to enable effective management of *Objects*. Reporting is done for both the TDA itself, helping it in its preservation planning and as input for **Risk Mitigation** (CPP-012), and for the designated communities and stakeholders that produce and consume the data. Effective reporting enables a TDA to conduct digital preservation and to select the *Information packages* or *Objects* when performing preservation actions.

Reporting on the content includes reports and *Provenance metadata* from other CPPs that perform actions on digital content. For example, this includes processes that periodically check the quality of the data in **Data Quality Assessment** (CPP-019) or during triggered events such as **Ingest** (CPP-029) and **Enabling Access** (CPP-025):
        
- Reports from periodic **Integrity Checking** (CPP-003);
- Preservation actions taken and documented in **Data Corruption Management** (CPP-004);
- **Virus Scanning** reports (CPP-007);
- **File Format Identification** (CPP-008) reports;
- **File Format Validation** (CPP-010) reports;
- **File Migration** (CPP-014);
- Data on **Emulation and Rendering Tools** (CPP-015);
- *Metadata* from **Metadata Ingest and Management** (CPP-016);
- *Metadata* from **Rights Management** (CPP-020);
- *Metadata* from **Significant Properties Definition** (CPP-022);
- Preservation actions taken and documented in **File Repair** (CPP-027);
- Data from the **Creation of Derivatives** (CPP-028) process;
- *Metadata* from the access and use of *Objects* in TDA by the designated community;
- *Metadata* on the data volumes and growth rates of the *Objects* held by the TDA.

As the purpose of reporting is to enable the preservation and the management of digital *Objects*, the reports usually cover the main types of data that a TDA operates with. This may include data on:
        
- File formats;
- *Technical metadata* and significant properties of *Objects*;
- Tools and software needed to manage the content;
- The health of *Objects* and actions taken to remedy errors;
- The hardware infrastructure;
- *Metadata* and metadata standards;
- The provenance of the *Objects*;
- The licenses and rights to retain, preserve and provide access to *Objects*;
- The level of usage of *Objects* in the TDA;

The report types produced in the reporting process can be categorised as follows:
        
- *Statistical data* (e.g. number of *Objects*, file sizes etc.): Used for helping a TDA or stakeholder assess the scope of preservation actions;
- *Provenance metadata* (i.e. documented preservation actions by the TDA): Used for assessing the state of *Objects*, the so called "health" of the *Files*, and to add authenticity by documenting the life-cycle of all digital content in a TDA;
- *In depth machine-actionable reports* (usually produced by tools): These are used as input in other processes conducted by the TDA;
- *Links to knowledge base resources* (e.g. file format registries): These are used to help a TDA in preservation planning.

Reporting activities as well as the report types listed above feed into a wide range of management processes and decision making. Some examples include:
        
- Risk assessment and preservation planning (e.g. using reports on file formats);
- Reporting to funders and stakeholders (e.g. by providing usage statistics);
- Capacity planning and purchasing decisions (e.g. purchasing and refreshment of storage infrastructure based on statistics on data volumes and growth rates);
- Compliance assessments (e.g. using reports on rights and participant consent to check that personal data is retained in compliance with GDPR);
- Optimisation and cost management (e.g. identification of expensive or inefficient processes based on execution time and steps required, or optimising the use of different storage classes for frequently or infrequently accessed data based on usage statistics);
- Identification of anomalies in error rates or failures (e.g. unusually problematic content from specific depositors);
- Deaccessioning of *Objects* (e.g. reports on *Objects* that no longer need to be retained because their retention schedules are about to expire, or reports on quality assessment that mean *Objects* no longer meet the needs of a designated community);
- Environmental sustainability (e.g. use of storage, processing and access statistics as an input to calculating carbon footprint).

When the process description uses the term *report*, it can be any of the above.

| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The TDA knows what *Information packages* it preserves and what they<br>                    contain | Without being able to locate and report the data it holds, the TDA cannot<br>                    perform any preservation actions or provide (e.g. searching by *Rights*, *Provenance* and *Descriptive metadata* within the *Information<br>                    packages*). |
| The TDA knows which file formats it holds and can locate these *Objects*<br>                    within *Information packages* | Without knowing in what format the *Objects* it holds are, the TDA<br>                    cannot plan preservation actions or inform the designated communities about<br>                    preservation strategies. |
| The TDA knows what metadata standards it holds and which standards apply to<br>                    which *Objects* | Without being able to analyse the *Objects* and their significant<br>                    properties, the TDA cannot plan preservation actions, provide discovery or<br>                    access. |
| The TDA maintains and generates *Provenance metadata* during<br>                    preservation | Processes that produce reports and *provenance data* must have their<br>                    output stored. This information is needed to analyse the *Objects* in a<br>                    TDA, create quality reports, provide designated communities with assurance of a<br>                    high quality digital preservation |
| The TDA knows its hardware infrastructure and<br>                    has a plan for its management | Without knowledge on the hardware infrastructure, the TDA<br>                    cannot maintain high-quality bit-level preservation and<br>                    report to the stakeholders. |
| The TDA knows the rights it has to preserve and<br>                    provide access to its holdings. | Without knowledge of rights and<br>                    retention schedules, the TDA cannot<br>                    know with confidence that it has the<br>                    permission to preserve its holdings or<br>                    whether it is holding content that should<br>                    be deaccessioned. |

| Requires      | CPP-015     | The process of selecting tools for emulation and rendering<br>                    provides data to the TDA for reporting to the designated<br>                    communities. |
| Requires      | CPP-016     | Metadata ingest provides new *Provenance metadata*.                                                                                           |
| Requires      | CPP-022     | To report on the characteristics of *Objects* for deeper analysis, the<br>                    significant properties must have been defined.  |
| Requires      | CPP-027     | Fixing invalid *Files* produces *Provenance metadata* and data<br>                    for quality reporting to the stakeholders.              |
| Requires      | CPP-028     | Creation of new *Objects* provides data for statistical reporting.                                                                            |
| Affinity with | CPP-029     | Ingest is both an important provider of<br>                    reporting data to the TDA (via other<br>                    CPPs) as well as a customer, as the<br>                    ingest checks and outcomes must be<br>                    reported to the producer. |
| Affinity with | CPP-025     | Enabling Access of contents include providing *Provenance metadata*,<br>                    statistical data and quality reports to the consumer. |
