# Metadata Extraction (CPP-009)

**Short Definition:** The TDA extracts characteristics (such as size, image dimensions, video codec, audio run time, creating application).

## Description and Scope
Metadata extraction is the process of analysing a File or a set of Files (i.e. a PREMIS Representation) by means of metadata extractor tools in order to retrieve its characteristics in an automated way. In the digital preservation community, this operation is sometimes referred to as “Characterisation”. Within EDEN, however, characterisation is used to identify all operations aiming to extract properties from digital Files (CPP-008 File Format Identification, CPP-009 Metadata Extraction, and CPP-010 File Format Validation).

Metadata Extraction is generally performed at a File level; in some cases it has to be applied to a complex file structure that is not wrapped in a container File. For example, moving images stored as a sequence of DPX Files are handled as a whole by the metadata extractor tool MediaInfo.

File properties as gathered through Metadata Extraction are generally considered “Technical metadata”. However, by parsing the File, the process also extracts a wide range of its internal Descriptive, Provenance and Rights metadata.

Knowledge of these characteristics is a key requirement for many subsequent operations. In particular, it is essential for CPPs producing new Representations (i.e. CPP-026 File Normalisation, CPP-027 File Repair, CPP-014 Format Migration, and CPP-028 Creation of Derivatives) as they require further Metadata beyond the file format information as provided by CPP-008. Audiovisual Files are the most obvious example: Most identification tools provide information about the only container format, while any of the operations mentioned above will need at least the video and audio stream format. This is equally true for all other data types: TIFF may contain image streams compressed by different algorithms, PDF 1.7 might be portfolios containing arbitrary Files, etc.

There are different types of extraction tools available: a) Generalist metadata extractor tools which are able to perform metadata extraction on a great variety of file formats of different content types (e.g. [Exiftool](https://exiftool.org/)), b) content-specific tools which cover most of the file formats for a specific content type (e.g. [MediaInfo](https://mediaarea.net/fr/MediaInfo) for AV Files), c) format-specific tools which are specialised on a particular format (e.g. [EPUBcheck](https://www.w3.org/publishing/epubcheck/) for EPUBs, [metaflac](https://xiph.org/flac/documentation_tools_metaflac.html) for FLAC Files, etc.). Metadata extraction therefore relies on a format identification and is performed differently depending on the file format. TDAs might decide to apply several metadata extractor tools if a single tool cannot extract all required properties.

Metadata extraction - like any parsing operation - can fail and result in diagnostic error messages. These errors require systematic analysis to inform troubleshooting. In particular, the following issues may be detected by Metadata extraction errors:
        
- Encrypted Files;
- Truncated or broken Files
- Files assigned incorrect file format information.

The output of the metadata extractor tools should be recorded in the Information Package, as Technical, Descriptive, Rights or Provenance Metadata. It may be recorded directly as-is, or mapped to a metadata standard according to the TDA policy on metadata recording.

| All preservation actions beyond bit-level preservation are based on a<br>                    comprehensive understanding of the File’s characteristics. | Files of poor quality may be unidentified.<br>                Derivatives may be unadapted to the end users’ needs.<br>                The result of a migration may be partial, as some parts of the source File may<br>                    not have been identified, thus not been copied to the target File. |
| Metadata extraction involves accessing the contents of the File. Hence it is<br>                    an<br>                    essential means to detect problematic Files (including errors like: corrupted,<br>                    non-conformant to format specification, encrypted or password protected, wrong<br>                    file format identification etc.). | Problematic Files are not detected.                                                            |

| Required by        | CPP-012     | Preservation actions (i.e. migration, emulation) in the storage depend on the<br>                    identification of Files that share the same properties. |
| Required by        | CPP-014     | File format identification is generally limited to an indication of the<br>                    container<br>                    format, while migration can apply to any property of the Files. Technical<br>                    metadata extraction is required to both assess the compliance of files format to<br>                    the Archive’s format policy and control the outcome of the migration. |

| May be required by | CPP-021     | The documented event, datetime, and Provenance metadata from the metadata<br>                    extraction may be required by AIP Versioning. |
| May be required by | CPP-027     | Tools extracting properties of the File or Representation are useful (and<br>                    sometimes even necessary) for identifying erroneous format structures. |
| Affected by        | CPP-018     | Either due to changing significant properties or due to updated tools,<br>                    metadata<br>                    extraction requirements can be affected. |

                        according to requirements collected by BnF. MPEG-7, one of its output
                        formats, being standardised and expressed in XML, was selected as the format
                        for Metadata to be stored in Archival Information Packages. As MediaInfo
                        provides natively MPEG-7 as one of its output formats, no mapping from the
