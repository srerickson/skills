# AIP Batch Export (CPP-006)

**Short Definition:** As part of an exit strategy, the TDA batch exports Information packages and all associated Metadata in a manageable format/structure for Ingest into another TDA.

## Description and Scope
While the TDA manages *Information packages* across their life cycle, stores them as *AIPs*, and delivers them as *DIPs* to its consumer, it also needs to plan for situations in which an export of *AIPs* becomes necessary.

Scenarios that require an AIP Batch Export include, but are not limited to:
    
- *Exit Scenario*: The TDA changes a major part of its system infrastructure, such as the digital preservation workflow software or the database.
- *Succession Planning*: The TDA ceases to exist and needs to hand over its archival holdings to a successor.
- *Additional External Storage*: The TDA wants to store additional offline copies of their *AIPs*. The *AIP* export will create a *physical* *AIP* as opposed to a logical one. This includes e.g. *Metadata* which might be kept in a database to be written into an XML or JSON *File*.
- *Disposal*: If the TDA decides to dispose data (e.g. as part of Re-Appraisal) the data might be handed over to an external entity such as a different TDA that wants to preserve it. The *AIP* likely contains a level of information richness (e.g. in form of versions and full audit trails) that the *DIP* format of the TDA does not offer.
- *External Request for Export*: An external entity (e.g. a customer for a digital preservation service) might request the data preserved by the TDA for use cases such as verification of provenance information.

This CPP may export 1-n *AIPs* including all *AIP* versions from the TDA to a storage location external to the archival storage. The target location can be located externally (e.g. an external SFTP server) or internally (e.g. to a different network share). The process makes no assumption as to the type of storage exported to (e.g. disk, tape).

The exported *AIP* should include all available information where possible (i.e. contain all *Files* and all accompanying *Metadata*). In addition to *Descriptive*, *Structural*, *Administrative* and *Technical Metadata*, this includes any *Provenance metadata* which might exist and describes any events undertaken on the *Object* during its lifespan within the TDA.

The format and structure of the exported *AIP* should be documented including an explanation of all internal identifiers or schemas that might be used within. This documentation needs to be provided as a sidecar *File* with the AIP Batch Export.

## Rationale / Worst Case

| Purpose                                                                                                | Worst Case                                                                                  |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| When a TDA is closed down, it will have to pass data on to another TDA as part of succession planning.<br>				This might have to happen on short notice. | Data is lost.                                                                               |
| When a TDA acts as a service provider, data will have to be exported in bulk to those who<br>				are subscribing to the service. | Data owner potentially loses control over data.                                             |
| If a TDA is using external services and systems, e.g. for storing and preserving<br>				its *AIPs*, then it may need to exchange or transfer *AIPs* to<br>				or from third-party services and systems. | Data is lost, data can't be efficiently transferred between TDAs and preservation services. |

## Relationships

| Type                    | Related CPP | Description                                                                                |
| :---------------------- | :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Requires                | CPP-001     | *Fixity metadata* is used to verify the integrity of data written into the exported *AIP*. |
| Requires                | CPP-002     | To ensure the integrity of the data during transport from the TDA<br>				storage, the exported *Files'* checksums need to be<br>				verified. |
| Not to be confused with | CPP-017     | By default, batch export does not remove the content from the TDA.                         |
| Not to be confused with | CPP-025     | Access is typically granted to the *DIP* which may be different from<br>				the *AIP* (e.g. the *DIP* *may* only present the last version<br>				or one of several *Representations*). The *AIP* contains all<br>				preservation *Metadata* which a *DIP* may not. |
| Affected by             | CPP-021     | Versioning impacts how the export will have to be run and where and how<br>				information about the versions may be found. In addition a policy might<br>				determine if only the last or all versions should be exported. |
| Affinity with           | CPP-011     | Replication creates new parallel copies of *AIPs* within a TDAs<br>				archival storage. AIP Batch Export exports *AIPs* to external<br>				locations. |
