# Identifier Management (CPP-005)

**Short Definition:** Identifiers are assigned to Objects, Information packages and/or Metadata, and managed along to their life cycle.

## Description and Scope
Identifier management is the process of creating and updating identifiers and assigning them to *Object*s, *Metadata* or *Information package*s. Identifiers are essential components of digital preservation systems, serving as stable, long-term references to Digital *Object*s that can remain valid even when the *Object*s themselves are moved, renamed, or migrated to new systems.

Identifiers must be managed throughout the entire life cycle, taking into account any changes to their associated *Object*s, *Metadata* or *Information package*s. It is important to consider that not all types of identifiers are globally unique, some are unique only within their own identifier system.

A Persistent Identifier (PID) system can be used to generate unequivocal [1] identifiers to ensure that *Object*s can be precisely identified worldwide. PIDs are machine-readable strings of characters that conform to a defined scheme. Through providing and updating the reference link in the *Metadata*, these identifiers prevent the fundamental problem of "link rot" and ensure reliable access to preserved Digital *Object*s over time. However, this requires continuous maintenance of the identifiers to keep the *Metadata* up-to-date. Depending on the use case, it may be useful to assign multiple identifiers from different systems to an entity. To be able to provide user-facing PIDs, a TDA must manage local identifiers which provide the minimal baseline for providing persistent access and control to the data.

Common examples of PIDs are Digital Object Identifier (DOI), Uniform Resource Name (URN), handles and Archival Resource Key (ARK). One advantage of using PIDs is that their *Metadata* can be used to not only provide information about the *Object* itself, but also about its status, access conditions, and storage location. Even *Object*s which are not publicly accessible or have been disposed, can be identified and described by a PID. PIDs can also be moved from one organisation’s administration to another.

All types of identifiers can be assigned to multiple levels of entities, creating a hierarchical identification structure that reflects the complex nature of digital collections and their preservation requirements. Identifiers are usually assigned on the level of a) *Object*s, b) collections and aggregations, and c) Information Packages (*AIP*s and *DIP*s). In addition, identifiers can be assigned to *Metadata* entities, collections of other related entities, and even institutions or persons.

Identifiers and their *Metadata* should be updated according to the entity’s life cycle. In particular, when an entity may be deleted, merged, split or become partially unavailable, its identifier should be preserved. Moreover, its *Provenance metadata* should be updated in order to provide proper detail of information to the end users about its initial entity as well as the relationships to potential new entities that were created from the initial one. When using PIDs, some changes (e.g. the creation of identical parallel copies of the data that create new internal identifiers for each copy) can be documented in the PID version *Metadata* without creating a new PID.

Identifiers in a TDA are created at specific strategic points throughout the preservation life cycle, with timing and methods varying based on institutional policies and system architectures. Identifiers are typically assigned during Ingest as part of the packaging process, ensuring that every preserved *Object* has a persistent reference from the moment it enters the system. However, some institutions create identifiers earlier in the workflow (e.g. during acquisition planning or transfer preparation). This is especially useful when using PIDs, since it allows for early referencing and tracking of *Object*s before they undergo preservation processing. Identifiers can also be created after the initial preservation processing is complete, particularly when the final preserved format and structure have been determined. Identifiers can be also assigned to services or *Object*s which are not stored in the TDA but only generated on the fly based on user requests.

Identifiers may reveal the hierarchical relationships in the identifier string (e.g. by using qualifiers [2]) or might hide them by creating a whole new string for components [3]. This CPP does not choose between these approaches. Similarly, it does not make any assumptions on the organisation in charge of managing identifiers and whether identifiers are managed by the TDA directly. Since **Identifier Management** is relatively resource-intensive and can also be performed outside the scope of digital long-term preservation, no assumptions are made here about the structure or organisation of this work area; instead, reference is made only to the entity “the identifier management service”.

[1]This term is preferred over the “unique” adjective applied traditionally to identifiers. Indeed, it suggests that an identifier must reference one and only one thing, while “unique” might suggest that the thing must be referenced by only one identifier

[2] For example, the identifier <id:c8b> will be assigned to a Representation, and <id:c8b/001> to its first component or file.

[3] In the previous example, the identifier <id:t5g> could then be assigned to the first component or file.

## Rationale / Worst Case

| Purpose                                                                                         | Worst Case                                      |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| The rationale for implementing PIDs in TDAs stems from fundamental <br>                    challenges in maintaining long-term access to digital objects and the core <br>                    mission of preservation itself. | Link rot as well as problems and challenges in:<br>                    <br>- Internal data management problems;<br>- System migrations;<br>- Format migrations;<br>- Activity tracking;<br>- Interoperability |

| :----------------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Required by        | CPP-016     | While ingesting into a TDA, the *Metadata* should be assigned an identifier. <br>                    Also, the management functions of the *Metadata* may require replacing and/or <br>                    updating identifiers. |
| Required by        | CPP-017     | When the life cycle of the Digital *Object* or *File* ends, the identifier <br>                    should be updated to “retired” status. |
| Required by        | CPP-021     | When an *AIP* gets a new version, the new *AIP* version must also <br>                    be assigned a new identifier. |
| Required by        | CPP-024     | Enabling Discovery should make use of identifiers.                                                 |
| Required by        | CPP-025     | Accessing Digital *Object*, *File*(s) or *Metadata* should be based on <br>                    identifiers as parameters. |
| Required by        | CPP-029     | The ingestion workflow is responsible for assigning identifiers <br>                    to various entities in TDA, such as *File*s and *Metadata*. |
| May be required by | CPP-004     | If a *File* is corrupted, it may need to be repaired or replaced. <br>                    During this process, a new identifier may be created. |
| May be required by | CPP-011     | When a Digital *Object* or *File* is replicated, the replica may <br>                    be assigned a new identifier. |
| May be required by | CPP-013     | The management and reporting should require that the data is <br>                    identified with identifiers. |
| May be required by | CPP-014     | During **File Migration**, the migrated *File* may be <br>                    assigned a new identifier. |
| May be required by | CPP-019     | The data quality assessment may include validating the <br>                    identifiers and their linked resources. |
| May be required by | CPP-026     | A normalised *File* format may be assigned with a new identifier.                                  |
| May be required by | CPP-027     | A repaired *File* may get a new identifier.                                                        |
| May be required by | CPP-028     | A derivative of a *File* may get its own identifier.                                               |
