# Integrity Checking (CPP-003)

**Short Definition:** The TDA supports periodic integrity checking, reporting any damaged or missing Files.

## Description and Scope
Integrity checking is a periodically performed process where a checksum is calculated for a target *Information Package* and compared to the existing stored checksum (as calculated in CPP-001 Checksum Generation and Recording). The goal of integrity checking is to confirm that a target *Information Package* has remained unaltered across its life cycle. A *TDA* must perform and document periodic checks, and the frequency of the checks should be defined in its policy as part of the Risk Mitigation (CPP-012) approach.

Integrity checking is closely related to the process of Checksum Validation (CPP-002). Whereas Checksum Validation is tied to *Ingest* (CPP-029), Enabling *Access* (CPP-025), or Replication (CPP-011) (i.e. processes where *Files* are transferred or new copies are created), Integrity Checking is related to continuous risk management. Integrity checking aims to mitigate bit rot and provides evidence for trustworthy preservation by maintaining a continuous audit trail verifying that a *File* has remained unchanged and authentic over time.

Periodic integrity checks are performed separately on all accessible copies of a target *Information Package* (for example, off-line copies in a dark archive are usually excluded from periodic integrity checks). Copies on different storage media might be subjected to different intervals of checks. The results of the integrity checks, including *Fixity Metadata*, should be documented as preservation actions.

If integrity checks discover problems in the integrity of the target *Information Packages*, this information must be clearly documented in a digital archive's system, so that the broken *Information Packages* can be restored from valid copies (see CPP-004 Data Corruption Management).

## Rationale / Worst Case

| Purpose                                 | Worst Case                                                                       |
| :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Periodic integrity checks on all copies | Data can get corrupted and degenerate (i.e. the chain of custody is not<br>                    safeguarded, and the authenticity of *IPs* may be destroyed) |

## Relationships

| :---------------------- | :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Requires                | CPP-001     | CPP-001 is responsible for creating checksums that are used in integrity<br>                    checking. |
| Requires                | CPP-012     | The frequency and target of periodic integrity checks (CPP-003) is defined by<br>                    an institutional storage management policy as part of risk mitigation (CPP-012). |
| Required by             | CPP-013     | Periodic integrity checking provides reports on the integrity of data and<br>                    reports corrupted *AIPs*. |
| Required by             | CPP-016     | The timestamp of the *AIPs*' checksums needs to be updated to keep<br>                    track of the last successful check. |
| Affinity with           | CPP-007     | Both processes aim to ensure the "health" of files. However, Integrity<br>                    Checking focuses on detecting technical corruption of *Files* (e.g. bit<br>                    rot), whereas virus scanning looks to mitigate human-made risks ( e.g. malicious<br>                    code). |
| Not to be confused with | CPP-002     | Both CPPs can get input from CPP-001, and both calculate a checksum from an *Information<br>                    Package* and compare it to a given checksum. The difference is that CPP-002<br>                    is done during the *Ingest* or *Access* phases (relating to<br>                    transfer of content, changes in space), while CPP-003 is done periodically<br>                    during the preservation of the contents in the archival storage (relating to<br>                    changes over time). Thus, CPP-002 and CPP-003 are not only triggered by<br>                    different processes, but also trigger different responses. |
